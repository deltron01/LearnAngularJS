    <!-- AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can 
use to add functionality to your application. But, you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications
New directives are created by using the .directive function.
To invoke the new directive, make an HTML element with the same tag name as the new directive.
When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive.

    };
});
</script> <!-- Note: You must add the value "C" to the restrict property to be able to invoke the directive from a class name. -->

<!-- You can invoke a directive by using:

    *Element name
    *Attribute
    *Class
    *Comment               -->
