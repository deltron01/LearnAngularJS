Angular JS Services : 

*In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.
*AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service
*The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page
*In AngularJS you can make your own service, or use one of the many built-in services.
*  Why use Services???
    --> For many services, like the $location service, it seems like you could use objects that are already in the DOM, 
	    like the window.location object, and you could, but it would have some limitations, at least for your AngularJS application.
		AngularJS constantly supervises your application, and for it to handle changes and events properly,
		AngularJS prefers that you use the $location service instead of the window.location object.
*Once you have created a service, and connected it to your application,
 you can use the service in any controller, directive, filter, or even inside other services.
 
 Angular HTTP : 
 
 *$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers.
 *The AngularJS $http service makes a request to the server, and returns a response.
 *shortcut methods of the $http service :
  -.delete() -.get() -.head() -.jsonp() -.patch() -.post()-.put()

 Angular JS Forms :
 
 *Forms in AngularJS provides data-binding and validation of input controls.
 *Input Controls : Input controls are the HTML input elements:
  -input elements
  -select elements
  -button elements
  -textarea elements
 *Input controls provides data-binding by using the ng-model directive : <input type="text" ng-model="firstname"> , The application does now have a property named firstname.
  The ng-model directive binds the input controller to the rest of your application. The property firstname, can be referred to in a controller.
  <script>
   var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
   app.controller('formCtrl', function($scope) {
   $scope.firstname = "Ali";
   });
   </script>
 *Form State & Input State : AngularJS is constantly updating the state of both the form and the input fields.
  Input fields have the followong states : 
  -$untouched The field has not been touched yet
  -$touched The field has been touched
  -$pristine The field has not been modified yet
  -$dirty The field has been modified
  -$invalid The field content is not valid
  -$valid The field content is valid
  They are all properties of the input field, and are either true or false.
  Forms have the following states:
  -$pristine No fields have been modified yet
  -$dirty One or more have been modified
  -$invalid The form content is not valid
  -$valid The form content is valid
  -$submitted The form is submitted
  They are all properties of the form, and are either true or false.
 *You can use these states to show meaningful messages to the user. Example, 
  if a field is required, and the user leaves it blank, you should give the user a warning
 *AngularJS adds CSS classes to forms and input fields depending on their states.

 Angular JS Routing :
 
 -The ngRoute module helps your application to become a Single Page Application.
 -If you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a SPA (Single Page Application),
  with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module.
 -The ngRoute module routes your application to different pages without reloading the entire application.
