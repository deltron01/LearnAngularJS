    <!-- AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can 
use to add functionality to your application. But, you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications
New directives are created by using the .directive function.
To invoke the new directive, make an HTML element with the same tag name as the new directive.
When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive.
-->
  <!-- directive: w3-test-directive -->

var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
        restrict : "M", //The legal restrict values are: E for Element name, A for Attribute, C for Class, M for Comment.
        replace : true, //By default the value is EA, meaning that both Element names and attribute names can invoke the directive.
        template : "<h1>Made by a directive!</h1>"
    };
});
</script>
</body> <!-- Note: We've added the <strong>replace</strong> property in this example, otherwise the comment would be invisible.
Note: You must add the value "M" to the <strong>restrict</strong> property to be able to invoke the directive from a comment -->
<!-- You can invoke a directive by using:

    *Element name
    *Attribute
    *Class
    *Comment               -->
